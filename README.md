Build your own bot to play Clash Royale (Windows only).

## Description

We present an advanced state generator, which is accurate and returns a lot of information.
It uses:
* YOLOv5 to infer the units and numbers
* Image hashes to detect the cards
* A simple function of the pixels to deduce the elixir

With a more powerful interpretation of the state,
we can start to build bots that can make intelligent decisions.

## Getting Started

* [Setup](https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot/wiki/Setup) your environment and the emulator.

* [Try](https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot/wiki/Tutorial-(Basic)) the basic bot building tutorial.

* [Learn](https://github.com/Pbatch/ClashRoyaleBuildABot/wiki/State) how the state is generated.
